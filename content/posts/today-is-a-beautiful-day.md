## Today is my favorite day!

Friday has always been my favorite day, it's almost calm and peaceful, and **I love it**!

## Things happened today included:

* I added a comment section to the blog, (comment to me below 👇🏻)
* I got introduced to an easier way to manage my blog. Yay!
* I woke up very early, and had a great breakfast 🤩

## My plan for the rest of the day:

This won't be put in bullets, cause I'm a very bad planner; so let's keep it like that for now :D

I hope I can do some Russian studying 🇷🇺, work a little on the discord server I created to speak Arabic with people want to learn it, join it here [https://discord.gg/WC3ZaH78g5](https://discord.gg/WC3ZaH78g5 "https://discord.gg/WC3ZaH78g5"), and I want to have some fun also.

This was it, I enjoyed having you reading my post, but anyway.  you are my friend!!

Yeah, I almost forgot, word of the day:

> DON'T re-invent the wheel unless you have a very good reason

#### Ciao!
