I would believe that there is no creator, and there is no objective morality or meaning; as everything is relative.

All the existence, all the beauty, all the order, all of that popped out of nothing!  
  
Reflect upon this fact alone, and you will see how absurd it's to think that the universe just came like that. Just appeared on its own, that's the silliest idea I ever heard. Atheists even might think these questions are silly, and we should only live our life, cause when we die everything ends with us.  
  
That makes me ask, why live at all if you will die anyway?! and no matter how long you have lived, it'll be like a _drop in a sea_ compared to your death.  
  
I don't want to say that, but the only logical behavior I see if I am an atheist is to end my life and escape all that pain we go through; there wouldn't be anything better anyway, death is the end.  
  
Fortunately, I'm a Muslim, and that's not the case to me, or it'd have been a great mess ladies and gentlemen! Share your thoughts below...
