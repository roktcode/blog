title = "Egypt football team lost the final ðŸ˜­"

I'm so happy that they lost, maybe Egyptians will start caring for more serious things, instead of hyping and celebrating unimportant stuff like football.

Egyptians are becoming poorer one day after another, and they still feel happy for something that doesn't really help them; instead, it destroys social bonds and causes people to even die when their team loses; YES, football does that in my country.

It gives young people false hope about the future, and convinces them that they can be big players who will run after a _ball ,_ thinking they are real warriors fighting for a universal case.

Let's focus on the important stuff that the bad people don't like to talk about, this is what will change our lives and unites us, **unite us for real!**

Word of the day:

> Don't be weak just because someone doesn't want to see you strong

Love you awesome readers!
