I'm so happy that they lost, maybe Egypttians will start caring for more serious things, instead of hyping and celebrating unimportant stuff like football.

Egyptians are becomin poorer one day after another, and they still feel happy for something that doesn't really help them; instead, it destroys social bonds and causes people to even die when their team loses, YES, football does that in my country.

It gies young people false hope about th future, and convinces them that they can be big players wheo run afetr a _ball ,_ thinking they are real warriors.

Let's focus on the important stuff that the bad people don'r like to talk about, this is what will change  our lives and unites us, **unite us for real!

Word of the day:

> Don't be weak just because someone doesn't want to see you strong

Love you awesome readers!
