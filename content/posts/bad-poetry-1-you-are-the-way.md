+++
You are the way, and I'm the car. Don't trust me? But we have been so far. Remember the start, imagine the end. Its true we are in love, so kindly send. Flowers in the air, carried by the wind, people are scared, so they will defend. I'm the star, you are the sky. Open your arms, don't act so shy. You can have me there, so I listen to your heart, when it's beating and beating, it's making me calm. **I feel you are warm, I listen to your breath, it's like a bird, that is spoiling her kid.** I need to have, that touch of love, it will make me calm, it can make make me calm.

I wrote that while sitting on a hard wooden couche, so don't feel it so much.. ðŸ˜‚
